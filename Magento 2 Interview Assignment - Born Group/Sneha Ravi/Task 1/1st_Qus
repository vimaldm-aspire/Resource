$a = '1'; 
$b = &$a; 
$b = "2$b";
echo $a.", ".$b; 

Output: 21, 21

Explanation: 
$b = &$a;   // $b = 1, b point the same memory that a points.
$b = "2$b"; // $b = 21, this line meant the the value of $b should always followed by '2' and so output is "21".

so when we change the value of $b then the $a value will also change to $b value. Because both $a and $b reference the same memory point.
