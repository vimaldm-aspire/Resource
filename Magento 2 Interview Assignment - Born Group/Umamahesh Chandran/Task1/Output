What is the output of the following code and explain why:

$a = '1';
$b = &$a;
$b = "2$b";
echo $a.", ".$b

variable $a and assigns the value ‘1’  
variable $b which points to the value of $a as 1
Next $b declare a value of 1

$a will be the same value, both refers same output  => $b = &$a;

OUTPUT: 21, 21
